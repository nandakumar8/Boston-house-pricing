regression model of housing price data

The model is used to predict housing prices in the Boston city area. Firstly the data is manipulated and checked for any skewness. Then a box-cox transformation is done. Ordinary least squares regression is done on the transformed data. The ridge estimates are used to check for multicollinearity. Using principal component analysis the regression is done using optimal components to reduce residual error. Partial least square technique is then used to improve the model parameters.
