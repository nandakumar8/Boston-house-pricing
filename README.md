regression model of housing prive data

The model is used to predict housing prices in the Boston city area.Firstly the data is manipulated and check for any skewness.Then a box-cox transforamtion is done.
Ordinary least squares regression is done on the transformed data.The ridge estimates are uused to check for multicollinearity.Using principal component analysis the 
regression is done using optimal components to reduce residual error.Partial least square technique is then used to improve the model.
